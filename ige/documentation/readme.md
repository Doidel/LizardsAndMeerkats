# Documentation
This folder contains some docs relating to the engine API. The documentation for version 1.1.0 is not yet complete but
these files are included anyway as they may be of some help. The docs are starting to get examples included so you'll
see in the IgeObject, IgeEntity and IgeClass files that examples exist for every major function. Further examples will
be added day by day.
