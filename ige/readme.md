# Isogenic Game Engine
HTML5 2D and isometric game engine version 1.1.0.

## Installation
If you have the premium (paid for) version of the engine please read this:

After downloading or cloning this repository, if you plan to use the multiplayer aspects of the engine you should run
(assumes that you cloned / extracted the engine repository to /ige)**:

    cd /ige/server
    npm install

This will automatically download and install any required Node.js modules.

** You must have Node.js installed for the installation to work and the engine's multiplayer / networking system is only
included in the premium licensed version of the engine and is not part of the "prototype" version (the free one).

## About This Version
This is a pre-release version of the engine. It is released under strict confidentiality and must not be shared with
anyone. You are granted a license to use this pre-release version for your own internal testing and development work but
no work generated using this version must be released until a generally available launch of 1.1.0 or you obtain
permission from Irrelon Software to do so. Irrelon Software will never deny you permission to release your game - we
only want to ensure that you have correctly packaged your game so that the engine is not available to download in
clear text. A packager system is included with the engine.

## Pre-Release
Whilst we are classing this as a pre-release version, it is very stable and the best version of the engine to build
new game projects with. Two production games have already shipped using this version from third-party developers.
Feedback about this version of the engine has been overwhelmingly positive and based on user response it is the easiest
and most feature-rich version to date.

## Examples
There are a lot of examples in the ./examples folder. Please see the ./examples/readme.md file for more information
about running the examples.
